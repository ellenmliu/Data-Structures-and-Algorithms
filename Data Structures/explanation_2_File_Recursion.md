Time Complexity: O(mn)
Space Complexity: O(mn)

The recursive function would have to go through each folder with in the each subdirectory. That would give us the time complexity of O(mn) where m would be the number of subdirectories and the n would be the number of files per directory. The space complexity will also be O(mn) because of the amount of subdirectories within a directory and n is the number of files that will need to store.
