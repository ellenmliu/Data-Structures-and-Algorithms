To store the order of the when was the key last access, I decided to use a doubly linked list as a Queue to easily access the head and the tail. That way we can easily append the key to the head for what was most recently accessed and pop off the tail to remove the least recently accessed key. That would ensure O(1) time when we use set(). However when we use get() right now, if we get() a key that is in the middle of the doubly linked list, we would have to traverse until we find it, so right now it's O(n). In order to have O(1) time when we get the value and put that as the most recently accessed in the Queue, the dictionary stores the Nodes of the doubly linked list so that the values can be easily accessed.
