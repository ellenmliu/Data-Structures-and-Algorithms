I used a dictionary to store the frequency so that would give us O(1) when accessing the frequency value of each char. To store the frequency, I had to iterate through each of the characters of the input, so that is O(n). The storing of the priority queue is O(n) because we are also sorting it every time. Dequeuing is also O(n) because we are popping the first element from the list. Creating the binary codes will take O(n) because it will go through each path until it reaches the leaf and assign the code. We would have to go through each letter of the input, data, in order to encode it so it would take O(n). Decoding we will also have to go through each character of the encoded input, so that would take O(n).
